Remind me to fix gamemodeshift redstone
-- repeated or finished? add an intention type, probably

be able to tell biff to do things when people get on,
 -- be able to do things in general
 -- teleport players, give items, relay messages, run console commands, etc.

 maybe abstractify this, and add a "when" type of parameter--When.NOW, When.WHEN_PLAYER_JOINS, When.SERVER_RESTART, etc, but.....
 probably not an enum. more like an interface or a sort of listener, maybe an internal clock, or pubsub or store "need-to-do" in a file



 get all the ideas from MiscListeners
